# AbaloneSexPredictor
Juypiter Notebook using ML to predict abalone sex from a data set

In this study, machine learning techniques were used to determine the sex of abalone specimens using the UCI Abalone dataset. The target variable Sex (Male, Female, or Infant) is a three-class classification problem. Once data preparation and exploratory analyses were conducted, PyCaret's automated machine learning framework built and evaluated multiple classification algorithms. Each model was evaluated and compared using the main classification metrics of accuracy, F1-score, and other commonly used performance measures. The best performing model was then tuned and validated using a holdout test set. The final tuned model achieved good predictive performance in classifying abalone sex from physical measurements, including length, weight, and number of rings. Overall, the results suggest that automated machine learning pipelines can be utilized to address biological classification questions, yielding reliable results with minimal human intervention.
